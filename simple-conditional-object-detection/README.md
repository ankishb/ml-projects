# Object Detection

This repo has a replication of `YOLO` model. I have used architecture from `yolo-v2` in addition to the `attention` layer to extract more fine-grained feature about the object. **This simple tricks helped me to increase the score by `7.27%` in a data-science contest sponsored by `Flipkart`.**  


This implementation for `YOLO` model is based on the following amazing repositary.
