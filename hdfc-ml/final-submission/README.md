# README
To run my code, Put `Dataset` in the `DatasSet` directory 
and run `final-submission.ipynb` file, which will take around 10 min. It will create a submission file named `final_submission.csv` in the same directory.

The description of my approach is explained in `2` reports attached in final submission. Also briefly explained on top of final-submission.ipynb file.

There are other file in directory, which represent all the codes to derive all the analysis and feature engineering.
