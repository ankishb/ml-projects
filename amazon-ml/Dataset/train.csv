Doesn't smell anything like rosehip oil. Smells more like cooking oil or stale oil. The fact its all opened without sealing protection makes me very suspicious of this product. Don't buy from this 365 company ever. May have the seal of organic approval but it's shady in the packaging. I'm not putting this on my face.

"I really do like these diapers. I’ve never had problems with them but this time I’ve ordered them, I’ve noticed a few things. One being that even though I got the size my daughter wears, they were still really really big! Which is weird because.. these diapers have never been like that before. Second thing is that they’re coming apart.. like one of the layers of the diapers which I’ve never noticed before. Idk if something changed with the diapers recently or if maybe I never realized these things when we’ve ordered them before. Besides that, I never have any leaks or problems, they’re absorbent and reliable! I always recommended them but now.. I’m unsure!","Loved them at first, now unsure",Texture

"So i got this because of the reviews and i love this brand, plus it seemed that it was a great concept for my macros!<br /><br />The thing i did not realize was the oats are kind of very finely ground and do not i repeat do NOT mix very well.<br /><br />I figured since this was whey and oats i would use warm/hot water to mix this up with since lets be honest who doesn't like a hot blueberry muffin! well even with the warm water as soon as you take a gulp of this it instantly drys the back of your throat causing you to cough. I love the flavor of it its just like it says blueberry muffin, but the dryness of the oats is a real downfall. i have not let it sit in hot water yet, but i do not think it will make a difference.<br /><br />other than that its a good product with great macros and a good flavor that is the only reason for the 2 stars. if it did not taste as good as it does than 1 star all of the way. my apologies optimum nutrition but this was a fail.",Dry,Bad Taste/Flavor

You only get 15 servings with a level 90cc scoop (which is included in the package).  They're lying through their teeth on the label which is despicable and unfortunate.<br /><br />They're pulling a similar stunt with their ""Perfect Food"" super greens powder where they've snuck a 20cc measuring cup in to replace the long-running 25cc measuring cup with no warning on the packaging whatsoever.<br /><br />Garden of Life is not trustworthy so just keep an eye on the packages and enjoy the shakes.. but know that they are not being honest with us.",Claims 20 servings but only provides 15 - #GardenOfFail,Bad Taste/Flavor

"Based upon the front labeling, I ordered this product thinking that each capsule had 750mg of 95% Curcuminoids.  However, after receiving the product and reading the ingredients on the back carefully, each capsule actually has 750mg of ""Proprietary Organic Curcumin Complex"" which is composed of Organic Turmeric Root and Organic Curcumin Extract standardized to 95% Curcuminoids.  I contacted the company and asked them what was the percentage of Organic Curcumin Extract.  They refused to answer.  Therefore, I have to surmise the product is mostly Turmeric Root which has less than 3% Curcuminoids.  So instead of getting more than 700mg of Curcuminoids per capsule, there is most likely only around 25mg per capsule which makes the product mostly useless.",Deceptive,Not Effective

"!!!!!!--->>300 mg of sodium per 1 scoop serving, with a recommended 1-2 scoops- possibly multiple times a day. ""Use between major meals and before and after exercise"" WOAH. Do the math! If you plan to use this to add some protein once a day and all else is pretty clean, then have at it. If you are using this to bulk up and need multiple servings each day (and/or are consuming anything canned, boxed, processed, or made in a restaurant), then BEWARE, be mindful, and take heed to the excess sodium you are taking in. Maybe blood pressure isn't an issue for you, but what about those excess pounds while you are trying to shred? Excess sodium is not your friend.<br /><br />---Dietary guideline for sodium is no more than 2300 mg, per day. Through food, drinks, and additional spices we easily top 3400mg or more. The idea is to push it back under 2000mg. So most people would do well to avoid high sodium products like this. The caveat is if you are someone who would benefit from replacing lost electrolytes from intense sweat producing workouts IF the replenishment beverage also contains a balance of potassium and natural sugar. This product is not made to address that. There is no potassium in this product, and the only sugar comes from Sucralose (like, little yellow packets of Splenda).  The sodium appears to be for taste.<br /><br />Even competitors have high sodium, but the highest brand is about half of what is here- given same amount of protein and grams per serving. CRAZY.<br /><br />-----Now that is just about sodium. What's up with Sucralose (Splenda) being used to sweeten it up? I won't get into the potential health hazard of these artificial sweeteners, but I will say that artificial sweeteners can make us want more sugary foods- which is not helpful when we are trying to lose weight, or aiming to add muscle to our body. Just drop the sweetener and maybe blend or shake in something cleaner, and easier on the mind and body.<br /><br />**Don't care about any of that? Here are some positives..<br /><br />--> Taste. Ok, so overall taste is fine. I used some unsweetened almond milk, ice, and a scoop of this product in a blender. The vanilla taste was rather bland. I typically like to blend in some frozen fruit and a couple of supplements, so the protein powder typically just serves as a base. After I made the basic smoothie, I added in a half of an under ripe banana. That seemed to make the vanilla pop, and the over taste improved.<br /><br />---> Protein absorption. One thing thing product has over some is that this product contains digestive enzymes which research alludes to being vital in assisting in protein absorption, which is what we want from a protein powder. 125 mg EACH of Protease and Bromelain for 250mg digestive enzyme blend.<br /><br />I like this last bit, a lot,  BUT the excess sodium will make me take a closer look at other products. I have a tendency to retain water as it is, so this is a no go for me. I think it is an easy fix for this company if enough people express sodium concerns.",Way too much sodium per serving,Shipment and delivery

"*Received free bottle for review *<br />I started with 1 pill 2 hours before meals for 3 days and then 3 pills before meals after that. I've found that it works better for me to eat between 30-45 minutes after taking them. After 3 weeks I noticed that I was averaging a loss of 1/2 pound per week and stomach fat reduction, not drastic just slight.<br /><br /> I added intermittent fasting 16:8 and some days OMAD at the start of the 2nd bottle. Eating lots of veggies and protein. Exercise 5 days cardio and strength training. 1200-1500 calories or less some days.<br /><br />This regimen has me losing 3-4 lbs per week! I also take the pills during fasting hours and seems to work well. It doesn't suppress my appetite as in the first 2 weeks though. I think it just blocks the fat at this point.<br /><br />Baby weight is coming off, C-section flap is shrinking but I honestly believe it is mostly due to intermittent fasting, diet changes and exercise.<br /><br />Update: 6/18/19<br />I've noticed in 2 weeks of no exercise and diet the pills did not work. I've researched and found that these are standardized to 60% HCA and that may be why I'm not seeing any results from the pills on their own.

"The OLLY Beauty Gummies are a great gummy to take if you’re looking for a non pill form of biotin to take.  Like most gummy vitamins, these vitamins are pretty much vitamin infused candy.  These gummies taste SO YUMMY - they’re soft and chewy and have a nice sweet grapefruit flavor.  The ingredients include glucose syrup, beet sugar, water, gelatin, natural flavor, citric acid, pectin, coloring from various fruits and vegetable juices, vegetable oil, and carnauba wax.  These vitamins include vitamin C, vitamin E, Biotin, and keratin.  Most of the supplements are small - vitamin C (15mg/17% DV), vitamin E (7.5mg/50%DV), and Keratin (50mg/DV not established) - but the biotin supplement is huge (2500mcg/8333% DV) but it’s still lower than taking a small biotin pill.  I normally take biotin as a supplement in pill form, and the one I’m taking includes 7500 mcg/25000% DV.  As a non pill supplement, I would totally take these simply because I love the flavor.  However, I personally don’t mind swallowing pills, so I would unlikely purchase these in the future unless I want to mix things up and have a candy vitamin to take.

"I have very mixed feelings about this product. I love using it as an afternoon pick-me-up/ post workout.<br />The container says two scoops is a normal serving, and you can use up to 6 scoops for a more intense “pre workout” burst of energy. I can tell you now if you plan on using 6 scoops for pre workout you’re going to have to drink it in about 1.5 gallons of water. The flavor is so strong, it needs to be diluted quite a bit to be tolerable. Yesterday I tried 4 scoops in a 10 oz glass of water (who wants to hit them gym with a stomach FULL of water?) and it almost made me sick. I’d compare it to trying to drink 3 packs of koolaid mix with out diluting it. 🤢<br /><br />Added: I just bought my second can of grape flavor. the first can had so much flavor I could hardly tolerate it, this second one has almost no flavor at all. Makes me wonder what other ingredients are inconsistent! Will not be purchasing again.","Awesome for a pick me up, that’s it.",Allergic

This is pricey for the size but it lasts long when you use it for getting rid of nail fungus.  I just pour 2- drops in the cap then dip a very small paintbrush (the brush hair part is only about the size of a long grain of rice.  I only use this brush for my nails) and apply it to my nails.  The first week or so it stings the skin mild to medium when it gets on the skin.  If you wipe the skin with water this really helps take away the sting on the skin.  Another thing that  helps is put lotion around the nail before you apply the oil.  The lotion reduces/removes the sting.  Either way the stinging goes away after a week.  It is not that bad and it lasts about half an hour if you don't wipe the skin.  I have only tried it for a short time with oregano oil and peppermint oil (which has menthol) and it does look like it is healing the nails some.  I think I will also get some Rosemary oil for some camphor and other antimicrobial properties.  I also like these oils because I regularly eat these herbs so I feel that they are safe for me.  Many years back I mixed a lot of essential oils and my nails were almost healed and then I didn't keep up the regular application of oils.

"I guess Vega is going after a different breed of consumer. I'm not impressed with this new formulation. In the past, I loved Vega based on the fact that it was clean and natural. I liked the taste too. I rarely do subscriptions for my ""X Brand"" purchases, but for the original formula, I did. I only stopped because I had an abundance and needed to catch up.<br /><br />I first saw this new formulation in the health food store and thought ""Wow, Vega discontinued their original. What a shame."" Yes, I read the ingredients. No, I wasn't impressed. Gone is the coconut oil powder, turmeric, ginger, ginseng and my favorite yerbe mate. Actually this whole line appears to have changed it's ingredients. That was strike 1.<br /><br />I decided to try it out today. I put a scoop in my shaker cup to mix it. Same cup, same style of shaking. It foamed up. Not mixed up - foamed up. That was first disappointing, then purely a turn off, because for me, that represents the others I stopped using because of their ""fake"" ingredients. Strike 2.<br /><br />Finally, I tasted it.  Acia Berry was my favorite flavor before, so I give stawberry/lemonade a try because, well, I like strawberry lemonade in general. Um, that's not strawberry lemonade I tasted! It had a very chemically taste to it. Again, this reminded me of the other stuff I stopped drinking because they had too many ""fake"" ingredients. To me, this new formulation is mainstream and just like the others now. Sorry Vega, sorry WhiteWave Foods, strike 3 for me.<br /><br />Did I get a buzz. Sure. It has enough caffeine to give me the pre workout buzz. So will a cup of coffee. But is it worth me buying another, for the same reason I remained a loyal customer all these past years. No. I'll try to finish the container, unless I find a suitable replacement. But I won't buy another; or I'll go back to what I'd stopped using before. I'm simply not impressed enough to pay for essentially a glorified cup of coffee. Thanks for the memories though, Vega.",Glorified cup of coffee,Bad Taste/Flavor

"The Nature's Bounty ClearComplexion Zinc Plus Manganese supplement seems like a good option for those looking for a zinc skin supplement. I got them for my wife hoping that it would help with her moderate rosacea, and while it hasn't made a hugely visible difference, she does say that it's helped with the intensity of it. The challenge with her is that she really hates having to swallow pills and capsules of any kind and these are small enough and easier to swallow than most supplements, so she takes it regularly.<br /><br />One thing to note here is that there is quite a bit of zinc here. At 30mg per serving (2 softgels), that's quite high (40mg is the tolerable upper intake level, but recommended dietary allowances are only 11mg for men and 8mg for women). Depending on your diet and what other supplements you take (most multivitamins have 5mg or less), you could get to that level pretty quickly. With these, you can reduce it to one softgel and still get plenty of zinc (and while that might leave you lacking a big of manganese, that mineral is generally much easier to get from healthy dietary sources like grains than zinc is). That's what my wife has done, and she's still received benefit from it.",Generally good zinc/manganese supplement. Very easy to swallow.,Too big to swallow

"As a senior taking a med for elevated blood pressure, I was uncertain if I should try these and held off for many months. I finally decided that it would be worth a try and began using one pill a day, taking it in the morning. I'd been a bit down, in mood, for a while due to a long winter and wet Spring, and needed a boost to get some tasks completed.  I was hopeful these might be the answer.<br /><br />I noticed an increase in my energy and motivation the afternoon of the first day, and the second day even more. I cleaned, planted my little garden, cleaned and organized our home and more while taking this for a few days. I felt good, not only due to my energy level, but due to completing the tasks I'd wanted to do for many weeks.<br /><br />I didn't really notice a change in my mood or ""happiness"", but I began to have trouble sleeping. After a number of restless nights of little sleep, I decided to cut back and take a half pill, which I did for a few more days. I finally just gave up as lack of sleep did the opposite to my mood from what my wish was, unfortunately.<br /><br />I hadn't see a lot of reports of similar effects in my online research, but there were a few. In most cases, there was no reference to the amount of Ashwagandah taken. These, 600 mg tablets are a reasonable and acceptable dose, but I've read that splitting it to 300 mg every morning and night is also a good plan.  I find it interesting that it's identified as a ""sleep aid"" when it had the opposite effect on me.<br /><br />I often have difficulty taking meds and supplements because of my easily irritable stomach and digestive tract, but did not with this Ashwagandah from Garden of Life. There are some probiotics in the blend, but it appears to be a small amount. Ginger is also known to be good for digestion, so the combination might be deserving of credit for my tolerance. If I could only sleep!<br /><br />To summarize, this supplement had some good effects for me, as noted above.  My sensitive digestive system tolerated it well, but I couldn't get adequate, restful sleep. As with all meds and supplements, their effects and tolerance are unique to the individual.",Increased Energy But Couldn't Sleep!,Allergic

That's so over the top.",Strongest flavor and most aggressive dying is Concord Grape,Bad Taste/Flavor

"I just found out that the type of B12 used in this supplement contains cyanide in the form of a synthetic additive called cyanocobalamin - read the label. The cyanide is organically bound to vitamin B12, and it has a potential for causing harm unless a person is in optimum health to begin with and their liver is able to effectively remove it. If a person's system is already dealing with toxin exposure (from the air we breathe, the water we drink, foods we eat, or any alcohol consumption or take prescription drugs of any kind), or you're one of the many people unable to metabolize B12 properly, it could mean that higher levels of cyanide are building up in your body and caution is advised. Smokers, too, can run into trouble and should be careful to avoid this type of B12. Unfortunately I didn't find this information out until after I'd consumed 1/2 the bottle. I've since learned that you can get biologically active B12 through diet by eating foods like white button mushrooms, chlorella, and spirulina, which are great sources. And, if you do need to supplement B12, you can get it safely by shopping for cyanide-free forms of B12 such as hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, or aquacobalamin, which I'm going to do from now on. After all, supplements are supposed to improve our health, not damage it. Green Med Info notes that the methylcobalamin form is the ideal variety (because it is the form that is found in nature and is ready for your body to put to use right away), although it does carry a higher price tag.",Buyer Beware!,Packaging

I highly appreciate if you share this with me. I took my prenatals from around June 2017 all the way until around Jan 2019, I started around two months before conceiving and through breastfeeding. My son's darkening of the skin showed up at around 4 weeks of age and became evident around 3 months old.",SKIN DISCOLORATION/DARKENING ON BABY,Allergic

"NOW makes great supplements and I take a few of their products with no issue. I gave this product 3 stars because although my experience was negative others may not have the same experience while taking. I used these for over 3 years before realizing they were the cause for increased anxiety and agitation. I found myself having so much anxiety, sometimes I didn’t even want to leave the house. I also would get angry much easier. When I realized it might be the cause of a supplement, I stopped taking everything, and my symptoms disappeared. I then slowly reintroduced until the anxiety came back once I started taking the Adam. I will also say my nails grew faster and looked healthier, as did my hair, but it just isn’t worth the anxiety. Maybe I have an allergy or adverse affect to one of the ingredients... regardless, I will not take again.","Gave me anxiety, but NOW makes great products",Allergic

"I wanted to try this Solimo Therapeutic Dandruff Shampoo because it comes in the 2.5% coal tar solution.  I've been using coal tar shampoos in 5% solution for many years and was curious about whether the lower percentage would work just as well.  For me, the 2.5% doesn't work as well so I will not repeat this experiment.  This particular formulation has a more pronounced scent, but it seems to fade away quite quickly and, even though I'm normally sensitive to scents, this Solimo version did not bother me at all.

"These vitamins are small compared to others I've used, and easy to swallow.  I love that they are vegan.  However, check to make sure the vitamins and minerals you are getting from these are the ones you need in the quantity you thin best.  For me, the one that stands out as odd is iron.  One tablet gives you only 17% of your daily value.  Vitamins for seniors usually have low or  no iron, but this isn't advertised as being specifically for seniors.

The oil smelled faintly like diesel fuel or like another oil had been added. I contacted the seller (WooHoo Natural) and they refused to offer me a refund or a replacement, referring me to NOW Foods. I would be extremely careful purchasing anything from this re-seller.","Tampered with, spolied, refused help",Packaging
"I am rating this 2 stars instead of 1 because the gummies do taste good and are easy to digest BUT! THEY DO NOT CONTAIN IRON which is a very important element needed especially in the second and third trimesters. I'm really not sure how it can be called a prenatal vitamin without Iron in it. I only found this out because I was suffering from extreme fatigue in my second trimester and my OB asked what type of prenatal vitamin I was taking to which i responded ""gummy"" which was indeed the problem. Low iron levels equals low energy and potentially anemia. If you are going to take this vitamin as your prenatal please talk to your doctor and have your iron levels checked and potentially add an iron supplement daily in addition to your gummy prenatal vitamin. I was just frustrated that I thought I was taking a full prenatal vitamin when in reality i was missing a vital nutrient.

"Well, the facial cleanser worked well enough. It comes in a pump bottle, which is very convenient. I've used it a couple of times and it did a great job freshening up my face, and I plan on using it as part of my evening regime. My face was considerably less oily and it felt rejuvenated.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the big issue with this product is the packaging. I knew something was wrong the second I cracked open the brown package. The twist top for the pump mechanism came unscrewed a little bit, but enough to let out a lot of the solution. The bottle was covered in slime and the entire inside of the package was coated with it. I'd say maybe 10% of the total bottle had come out.<br /><br />Sometimes companies separate the pump and the bottle to prevent this kind of thing. They also seal the bottle so it can't be tampered with. Unfortunately, ""X Brand"" did neither of these.<br /><br />It's a good product, but if you were to buy it I'd recommend ordering it separately so it can't damage anything else it gets shipped with.","Good product, awful packaging",Packaging

Basically 32 ounces for free compared to Monster Purple.<br /><br />4) The decision maker for me was the caffeine effect.  Monster cans spread the energy rise/rush out over two hours.  Solimno red hits you hard all at once and burns down quickly.  Caffeine flush is guaranteed if you drink one fast.  For people who use a monster to manage Shift Work Disorder, this is not for you. Slow sipping a Monster over an hour will be way more effective, leaving you less jittery.<br /><br />I will not be purchasing this again.  Spend the extra $4 for a Monster Purple or Orange.",Not a good Monster replacement,Allergic
"I actually started taking these prenatal vitamins after giving birth while I was nursing since I ran out of the tablets that I had. They don't taste bad (sometimes the fake fruit flavors are disgusting), however, I was able to taste a hint of the fish oil in some. They are chewable and soft in texture, so beware that they will get stuck in your teeth like a gummy candy. Lastly, make sure to read the serving size, because in order to get the full nutrients on the nutrition facts label, you need to take 2. Overall, I prefer the tablets, but if you have a difficult time swallowing the larger prenatal tabs, these would be a good alternative",good taste,Texture

"I'm a real person. I bought the GNC Pro Bulk 1340 expecting the god of all protein powders, But my initial overall opinion of this powder is lackluster.<br />I thought “gainer 1340” was just a cool name for a protein powder. I felt stupid to realize that this was the amount of calories that were in 4 full servings of this product. Which is a lot. Which is good. It means this thing must be loaded with carbs and protein right?? Well, not the case actually. Comparing this product with my previous mass gainer that ran out, I was surprised to find out that this powder had over double the calories, but still less carbs AND PROTEIN than my previous powder! Which begs the question where are all these calories coming from. Well judging on the taste of it, probably sugar. It is a very sweet drink that taste quite nice compared to most other products. It has a little artificial taste, but overall it went down smooth. Also the amount of Vitamin D in this powder is insanely low compared to my previous powder. This powder screams cheap filler protein powder to me. I would not recommend this product at all, unless you are really struggling to gain weight and want a protein powder that is palatable and calorie dense. Scoop sizes are a little bigger than average, but doable. Also it’s important to note this product has a gram of creatine monohydrate per 4 servings, so if you are at all worried about the male pattern baldness side effect from taking creatine. I would stay away from all protein powders that have it in them.<br /> I do not look forward to forcing myself to drink this powder for a month. It is 650 calories over my previous shake, so I guess I’ll start running 6 miles now. Also I’m going to have to find foods to replace the missing carbs and protein that I got when I bought this product.<br /><br />FYI this is just my initial review. I'll take this for a month and probably leave another review.","Just bought this product, my initial opinion",Too Sweet

"""X Brand"" Brand Revly Vegan Prenatal multivitamin contains many vitamins that basic prenatals do not include.

All of these vitamins are over 100% of the daily value in some of them are over 200% of the daily value.<br />  The reason why I am opting out of taking two of these a day is that of the percent of folic acid in the formula.

"I was taking these for months while trying to conceive and 8 weeks in to my pregnancy. During my first prenatal appointment, I was informed that Folic Acid is inferior to Folate. After a little research to confirm, I learned that excessive folic acid intake is correlated with significant health risks. I switched to SmartyPants Prenatal vitamins that contain Folate.<br /><br />Before folic acid can be utilized by the body, it must undergo two conversions—to dihydrofolate (DHF) first and then tetrahydrofolate (THF). Only then, can THF be converted to L-methylfolate, which is the end form of folate that the body requires for many key functions and to prevent birth defects.",Folic Acid is inferior to Folate,Ingredients

"I thought my husband could take any pill but he says this one is at his limit, size wise. It is large and it's not coated at all. It's also smells really funny. If you've ever been in an animal feed store, that is what this pill smells like.  Glad he's taking them cause I could not.  I wish it didn't have any Vit D in it cause they never put in there how much is needed and they don't use the best form of Vit D either (D3 isn't vegan and this is a hefty load for D2.) I have to figure it in to his Vit D supplementation, using his liquid emulsion, to make up the difference. It also would have been nice if they took out the supper insufficient amount of calcium (best if taken separately) and added the amount of iron that men are supposed to take. Especially since this one is good for vegetarians and it's common for those that don't eat meat regularly to be low in iron. Oh well, it will do for now until I can find a replacement.

"I've used this as a way for making up my daily protein goals for lifting, usually 1-2 scoops a day. I noticed I was developing a weird dry scaly skin problem on my abdomen. I figured it was the eggs, the insulin I used, milk, or the whey protein. Because those were things I used constantly every day.<br /><br />Fast forward, I fasted and used steroid cream to finally exfoliate this weird skin problem off of me. Doing detox herbal diets and celery drinks and what have you. I finally got to using whey again, very sparingly and here and there. Losing gains in the process. I decided to take 4 scoops one day for the hell of it and the next day, my stomach is more visibly noticeable with the skin problems. The skin traits are as followed: darker patches overlaying normal skin but also dry, difficult / impossible to exfoliate off, just annoying to see. Skin is really a reflection of your health, so I took this into greater consideration.<br /><br />It's highly probable that it is the whey protein doing because that was the only thing I changed to my routine.  That, or the C4 workout I used but I highly doubt that. I barely used C4 and I started a week ago.<br /><br />This powder tastes cool and everything, making shakes and stuff. But you know, I would probably only use this once or twice a week now since discovering this. Real, whole foods beats this by a long shot. Harder to meet your daily requirements but you know what's going in your stomach. I hear Pea Protein is much healthier.","Tastes good, but give me weird skin problems",Texture

"I tried the woman’s gummies, while the little ones had the kids version. For organic gummy multi vitamins, they were cheaper than our usually ones.<br /><br />For the woman’s ones, they were kind of slimy when you start to chew. It was a texture thing.

So, I keep a variety on hand, just give them what they want from the selection and be done with it! They did eat these, so no complaints here. But next week it can be a different type.

"This product was actually detrimental to my daily health. I’m currently cutting down on weight and have been doing so for 3 months, my diet is strict and I am consuming high protein meals so my plan recommends a digestive enzyme for nutrition absorption. I was taking GNC Super Digestive for the first 3 months of my routine and ran out so I picked this up. For the past 7 days of usage, there have been no changes to my diet, workouts, sleep, or stress except for the enzyme and I have never felt worse. My stomach feels bloated every morning, I feel like I can’t eat anything despite being on a lower calorie diet, and laying in bed feels uncomfortable. My weight has actually increased and am now figuring out a way to counteract the side effects. Please do not purchase this, there are better options available.",Felt bloated,Allergic

"Background- I am 31 years old, 6'3 218 lbs about 13% bf right now, I played semi pro football from 19 to 21, I was a Fitness Trainer at 24 hour fitness from 23 to 25 so I know a very good amount about working out. I currently play basketball in a mens adult league and I do MMA twice a week, and have been doing this for the last 7 years. My first cycle creatine run since I was 25.<br /><br />Pros- I did have a very fast recovery despite my intense workouts, currently used this product for 8 weeks straight. I did lose 14 lbs in 8 weeks almost all body fat and did gain some muscle as I took this while cutting but still consuming 1G of protein per body lb, stacking with glutamine, and BCAAS. So I can't necessarily say the fast recovery because of the creatine. I did do this with a loading phase for 5 days and 5 grams per day afterwards while drinking 2/3s to 1 gallon of water per day for 8 weeks straight.<br /><br />Cons- I have used better creatine in the past and can tell you when stacking it with glutamine and high quality bcass, the muscle growth was much better in the past. I think there is much better and higher quality creatine out there. My recommendation if your going to jump on creatine and put in all the effort and time in the gym spend a few more bucks and getting something of higher quality. Right now I am going to take 4 weeks off of creatine as I just finished my 8 week cycle and going to try Threeatine by crazy muscle on my next run. Little more expensive for the quantity but I have heard great things about it and will jump on that on July 1rst. Nope sure if it's any better but I will not buy this product again.

The only way that I made this work was to actually fold the sides a bit and stick them on to themselves. This works but when put to the test, which thank goodness didn't happen, you then have absorbent material wrapping around to the outside of your underwear. That is just not going to work.

"This is a high quality multi vitamins for the ones who are extremely concerned about any artificial additives and absorbing excess levels of vitamins.  Indeed, this is a very low multi-vitamin supplement.  Most vitamins are at or below the 100% of daily value which many consider as a minimum for maintaining health.<br /><br />I give it a less than perfect rating for two reasons.  The first one is the label of supplement facts is just about unreadable.  That is really unacceptable and so easy to fix.  Just use a descent font size and shape for that portion of your label.  The second reason is that the pills are huge.  That is probably the trade-off for such pills being so natural and pure.  However, any one who has issues with swallowing medium to large size pills will have to stay away from this supplement.  I think the first problem is easy for the company to resolve; meanwhile the second one is probably something that the customer has to be aware off when dealing with more natural supplements (they may be a bit bulkier).","Good supplement, but pills are very large and ingredients label is unreadable.",Too big to swallow

This bottle has a plastic stopper (image attached) with a tiny hole in it to allow for dispensing drops at a time. This is supposed to be stuck to the bottle. I also have a now foods eucalyptus bottle which has the plastic stopper press fit into it. The stopper on the lavender bottle is not press fit but just stuck on it and not stuck very well. The first time I tried to dispense the oil, the stopper came off and the oil spilled all over the counter and the floor. I was able to save some but most of it spilled out. I don't know why the stopper is not press fit but please ensure that stopper is snug before using the oil or the oil will spill out.  I gave 4 stars for the scent because it is strong, 5 stars for longevity because my previous bottle lasted for years but will give a 1 star for presentation because the packaging is bad.<br /><br />Attached image of the stopper which is not firmly affixed to the bottle. This product will get a better rating if the stopper is changed to be press fit instead of hardly being glued on.",Spilled most of the oil as the stopper came off.

The recommended dosage of Omega-3 fatty acids is 1000 mg at about a 2:1 ratio of EPA and DHA. Sure, these supplements are cheaper than others at first glance, but you’d also have to be taking four a day  to reach your daily recommended dosage - so the price tag is a little deceiving. Also, there is no mention of the breakdown between EPA and DHA, the bottle just says it contains both...a little odd and kind of eludes to them not nailing down the correct ratio. Lastly, they don’t talk about where the fish oil is sourced from - that makes a difference with it comes to things like heavy metal concentration.

It's larger.  Thus you will go through the product more quickly.  It's almost like what other brands do in the supermarket that shrink the packaging down in size but you pay the same.  The supplement world does the opposite so that you use more product up faster and have to buy more.<br /><br />I don't know what the heck they did but I won't be buying this anymore.  It's a shame.

"I thought all of the other reviews about the taste were just a bunch of people whining because it doesn't taste like a chocolate bar or a dessert....boy, was I wrong! Let me be clear...its not the worst tasting powder out there, its actually mildly sweet and not too artificial tasting. But it does have a weird smell to it and unless you are mixing it with frozen berries and other flavor enhancing items you will notice a not so good taste to it. Just like other reviews have mentioned, it does clump...A LOT...but thats the nature of casein proteins so you can't really complain about that I guess. I mix mine in a NutriBullet with a bunch of other stuff to minimize the taste. I will say that where this powder gets my respect is in the fact that up until now it has never made me feel bloated or overly full like many other powders. Even though I am rating it three stars I might just buy it again shockingly BECAUSE it doesn't bloat me like all the other casein powders. In the end I am happy with the product but not ecstatic. Maybe the three stars is a bit harsh now that I think about it, maybe its like 3 and 1/2 stars...but I simply can't give it a 4 star rating....oh well, sue me. lol.","The value is great, an no bloat...but that taste!!!!

"These taste great, I trust that they have the “nutrients” in them that they state on the packaging, and if you like gummy treats and have some extra cash, go for it. That said, they are never going to make a noticeable difference in the look of your hair, skin, or nails. Why? Two of the three ingredients that are sold as ‘benefits’ are in almost every type of gummy on the market - keratin is in most gelatin, it often comes from horse hooves, and it hasn’t been proven to do anything in humans after being digested. Vitamin C is also in most citrus flavored canary and tart candy, in the form of citric acid. It just also happens to have some vitamin C in it. The last one - Biotin - is in most multi-vitamins... but it’s also in vegetables, in a form that your body can absorb a lot more easily.<br /><br /> I don’t want to say these are bad- they aren’t.. They’re actually tasty and the simple fact that they recommend two a day makes it a nice little treat without going overboard. But if you’re looking to go from ‘meh’  to fabulous, that’s just not going to happen by eating these.","Tasty, expensive treats with a tiny benefit",Bad Taste/Flavor

They also don't have the best texture in my opinion, they are a little bit harder than I was expecting, and don't chew fantastically.

"First off, I'd normally give Garden of Life meal replacement 5 stars, but I'm trying to get the attention of someone that can help me with an issue of a bad batch I received. I've been drinking this powder for a year or two, and after trying chocolate and vanilla flavors, I decided vanilla was the lesser of the 2 evils.

Not too long ago, I ordered 3 big containers when they went on sale and have already used up one. When my husband made a shake with powder from the second container (on April Fool's) he thought we had played a nasty trick on him and put acid in his shake. I thought he was being dramatic and had just forgotten that this powder isn't meant to taste like dessert.

I’ve had many protein powder over the course of 9 years and this one really clumps up especially if you put it in before liquid. As a protein powder itself it’s not to bad. taste good and it’s not a bad value but what’s the point of buying it if it just stick to the bot of the cup. Clumps of protein floating around doesn’t really bother me but if it bothers you I wouldn’t recommend. It takes around 20oz of water and a decent amount of shaking with a shaker cup to get no clumping and with that much water the flavor gets really diluted. It taste really good like I said.

I often stuff my bags full with cereal or granola. I think I've had other bags (Ziploc, Walgreens, Kroger, Meijer, Walmart, etc.), and I've never seen them tear like this. These Solimo bags will tear at the seal with the slightest pull. And they will tear clean off (plastic from seal). It's very weird. In my pictures, the bag I'm holding (and at the bottom) tore from putting items in the bag and attempting to close it.

"Positives:<br />+ I added a supplement that I know is healthy and beneficial to/for my body to my system for not quite a month.<br />+ I appreciate the information that is on the box that seeks to educate the consumer about Reishi mushroom.<br /><br />Neutral:<br />+/- It was hard to know what to look for, as I didn’t notice any “change.” Maybe I have too much ‘wrong’ with me to notice an immediate effect on me with just one bottle(?)<br />+/- I found nothing that indicated as to how long one should or shouldn’t take it at the recommended dose. There wasn’t much I could find on altering the dosage, but for me, to make it last longer, I ended up taking half of the recommended dose. Don’t know if this has less of an effect(?)<br />+/- I *think* the box said it, but I cannot find it at the moment (though I save it,) about the purity of the reishi - e.g. I don’t know where this was grown, I don’t know anything about nor do I have any means by which to research easily this product. I appreciate how one brand of a line of supplements allows you to “research” that particular bottle, even, and look into the specifics (in essence) as to what went into that supplement.<br />+/- Nothing to write home about, but I don’t have anything, unfortunately, to compare it to, and I don’t have it in my budget to buy more bottles of this and/or others to experiment over the period of a year or more.<br /><br />Negative:<br />- Feel like there are so few and that one has to take more to get the same effect that should be fit into one capsule. (Maybe this is just t preference, but I think that if a company can fit 5,000 its of Vitamin D into a capsules less than the length of a dime, or about the size thereabouts, “one” should be able to fit the nutrient contents of a supplement into one pill/capsule/tablet/etc. instead of one dose being two.<br /><br />Would I recommend: sure. But I am not a die-hard for this particular brand and/or product. I wouldn’t particularly advise against it, but I am not extremely thrilled or pulled more towards telling my friends and family to go out and get it.","allright / it's a supplement with proven helpful benefits (Reishi mushroom, that is)",Not Effective

"I have used ""vitamin C & manuka honey gel cleanser"" for many, many years. It was a wonderful gentle cleanser.<br />My recent purchase of this item was shocking! The formula is a completely different product! It is thick, gummy, drying and smells terrible (like peroxide cleaner).<br />I reviewed the ingredients and see that indeed the ingredients have changed.<br />This new cleanser is no longer light and is in fact gummy and terribly drying to the skin.<br />NOW Please bring back the original formula. NOW should discontinue this item or at least call it a different name as the formula is nothing like the original formula.

I'm nearly through the first bottle and will order again. I don't know if it works as well as Krill or Fish, but I do believe it works good enough to be of benefit. After all, how good does it really have to be?<br />UPDATE 4/22/19  ***  Have to withdraw my previous praise for this product. Toward the end of the bottle, maybe 20 pills remaining, I began suffering terrible intestinal and stomach upsets. After I eliminated a few other possible causes, it kept happening. Finally, I read up on the side affects of Flaxseed oil and saw that stomach and intestinal upsets were just about the number one side affect!  Stopped taking it and, immediately, the upsets stopped and I get back to normal. This is not about Nature Made or ""X Brand"" because both have excellent products and services. This is just about Flaxseed oil in general. I won't touch the stuff again, that's for sure, in ANY form!",WONDERFUL PRODUCT ! (NOT ANYMORE!),Bad Taste/Flavor

"This is my first time ordering ON although I've used protein powder for years.  My old favorite brand is no longer in business, so when a friend recommended something, I tried it.  The flavor is horrible - you can barely taste the chocolate with the phoney, milky mess that one would have to call the ""flavor"" which is not like anything I've ever run into previously.  I found an old, ancient container of protein powder in a cabinet with a little left.

To say the least I will never, ever purchase this brand again.",Horrible,Bad Taste/Flavor

Red 40 is especially concerning for its possible link to health issues and cancer and sucralose has also potentially harmful side effects.

"Update: After taking these for almost 3 months I have noticed a considerable difference compared to other notropics. Mental focus is almost non existent, there is no type of energy boost. I'm disappointed because I ordered them for myself and my son (HS student looking for a little extra concentration help) . I took the max dose of three capsules daily. Two in the A.M. with my protein shake and one with lunch.<br />I'll be switching back to my old notropics brand and thankfully they are also part of the subscribe and save program.<br />I will say that I switchet many of my supplements to the ""X Brand"" brand and have been completely satisfied with them.<br />I hope this review helps with your decision. Although I will say that different notropics work differently for different people. I would suggest giving this brand a try to see if it works for you. The price is unbeatable compared to others out there.<br /><br />Three stars for mediocre results. I'm not sure if these are supposed to give immediate results or something that needs to build up into your system. I am ordering my second month supply now and hopes that it's something that will improve my concentration and memory over time. I've taken several different nootropics some of which act almost immediately and others that I've taken quite a while to build up into your system. I'll update my review after my second month.<br />I'm currently taking three capsules daily. Two in the AM and one mid afternoon.<br />I'm confident in ""X Brand"" brand supplements quality and after reading the reviews I find it hard to see that this stuff doesn't work.",90 day review,Not Effective

"The Nature’s Bounty Optimal Solutions Stunning Complexion Gummies are an okay supplement if you’re looking to increase your intake of zinc.  As a trace mineral, zinc is found in every cell of our bodies and only needed in small dosages. In studies, it was shown that skin has six times the amount of zinc in it, so taking a supplement like this would hypothetically be good for your skin.  While I found the supplement worked just fine and delivered 30mg of zinc (273% daily value), I also noticed the supplement was primarily corn syrup and sugar.  It’s pretty much a zinc infused gummy candy, which isn’t bad if you don’t like taking pills.  The gummies are slightly firm, and to get the dosage needed per day, you’ll have to take two gummies each day on an empty stomach.  I personally didn’t like the taste of these gummies however - I’ve tried a lot of vitamin gummies, and these are probably one of the yuckier tasting gummies I’ve eaten.

I scrubbed the spot again, mopped under the spot on the hardwood, rented a carpet cleaner, used the strongest possible solution for the cleaner, and here we are throwing our whole carpet away. This product is truly foul. My boyfriend is going to continue using it but just beware, especially if you are using it for younger kids, or spill prone adults.

Other than that, I felt nothing at all. I proceeded to take 2 more, then after a while took 3 more. So I took a total of 10 pills in a 2 hour time frame and no benefit surfaced.

"I thought this might be a good replacement for my generic Great Value brand coal tar shampoo, however it smells so bad that I can't continue to use it. Of course, no coal tar shampoo smells like roses, but I find that the smell of the Great Value version isn't that offensive and it goes away as my hair dries. The smell of this shampoo lingered strongly for at least 24 hours until I could wash my hair again. If you have a sensitive nose, it might be rough. The smell kept waking me up as I tried to sleep after my shower. I wish they could figure out a way to make my sweet smelling shampoos cling to the hair for as long as this did. It's difficult to describe, very chemical, like being in a cloud of cheap industrial air freshener all day long, very choking if you're sensitive to strong odors.<br /><br />I did notice that my hair was very soft and clean after using it, for what it's worth. I have mild dermatitis along my hairline as well as general general dryness and itching that I aggravate with too hot showers. The Great Value version keeps this under control very well.

But this ON stuff is gross and has that chemical sucralose mouth feel, kind of chalky and sickly sweet.<br />I wanted to give it a fair shot so I made it as nice as I thought possible, left out my other usual ingredients, added a couple ice cubes and reduced the water and that helped a little but intensified the nasty mouth-feel and sweetness.

I bought the DHA250 as it was easier for my 9 year old daughter to swallow. After taking it to close to the end of the bottle I notice it had a black dust coating the fish oil capsules. When I turned over the bottle I noticed the silica packed was not closed properly those causing it to coat all the capsule. It says do not ingest and I don't know how much of it has been ingested by my daughter over the past month. I will be sure to take the matter up with their customer service.

"I have been taking 10 mg of Melatonin each night for years now.  It's part of my usual regimen of old-man pills I take each night.  I currently use the Nature's Bounty Melatonin 10 mg which dissolves under your tongue which is excellent.  I was hopeful for these gummies, but there's a number of reasons why I won't be buying them again.<br />1) Tough to chew.  You have to chew through 2 of these to get 10 mg.  And they're not easy.  Definitely tougher than your standard gummy bear or candy.<br />2) Not cost effective.  Because you have to take 2 gummies to equal 10 mg, This bottle of 70 gummies equals 35 days of 10 mg effect.  It currently costs about $20 for 1 bottle.  Compare this to Nature's Bounty Melatonin 10 mg, 45 Quick Dissolve Tablets - it's priced at 8-9 bucks!  And you get 45 pills!  That's 45 days worth of stuff!  Why on earth would you pay twice as much for fewer days of product?<br />-<br />Taste is fine.  Effectiveness is fine.

As well, compare it to Centrum Silver, which is roughly twice as much, but you have that trusted name, and more vitamins/minerals as well in the Centrum.<br /><br />While I’m not sure that more percentage of vitamins/minerals matters—what we don’t need we release from our bodies unused—if you want more percentages, and as well if you want iron (there’s no iron in these Solimo), then you may want to compare brands as well and make a choice that fits you and fits your budget.<br /><br />I will take these Solimo, but likely will return to the Centrum knockoff I’ve been taking for quite some time now—the prices are around the same (with Solimo maybe a little cheaper), but I’ll be receiving a little more bang for my buck.<br /><br />However, Solimo brand has no weird taste or weird odor to it, so that’s a good thing.  What it also has going for it is: no artificial flavors, no gluten (if that matters to you and it doesn’t to me), and no lactose. That would make me take a second look at perhaps crossing over to the Solimo for the no artificial flavors and no lactose. I’m still on the fence and deciding.<br /><br />It’s really not possible to know exactly what’s happening to my body on a cellular level with vitamins/minerals I take, or to know any real difference between the Solimo and the brand I am taking—it’s unlikely I will feel any difference in my body and energy, etc—so, I have to go on the smaller details.<br /><br />All in all not a bad vitamin. Compare what’s in it with your usual multi and see what fits your own needs.",Compare to Centrum & Centrum Knockoff ....,Bad Taste/Flavor

"I've been really disappointed with my c4 experience over the years. It's been a fall from grace. The Watermelon flavor used to be sweet and pack a punch like a jolly rancher--it was fantastic. This was about 5 years ago. I continued to order c4 for another year after that, then the recipe changed to a much milder version. It was a shell of its former self. From there, I made a fuss about my annoyance with the change of flavor, so I stopped for a couple years, trying some every now and then to find out if they had changed it back. It never happened, until recently!  Except the flavor wasn't changed back to the great old flavor, it was changed to this new variant. It tastes like a slightly sweeter Watermelon N.O. Xplode.<br /><br />N.O. Xplode always upset my stomach, and since it was much cheaper, I suspect this was a part of the problem. For C4 to go this route of a new recipe for the second time in only a few years is really disappointing. It really feels like Cellucor is out to cut corners, and this time it's apparent with it's similarity to N.O.",Fall from grace,Bad Taste/Flavor

"It's a real shame about this product because its evident that this company is trying to provide a high quality, safe product for Vegans and Vegetarians. I've been taking these vitamins off and on for a few years until I had bloodwork recently done which indicated I was deficient in some vitamins. The recommended dosage of this product is 3 tablets daily. I started taking 2 tablets daily only 4 days a week. I was symptom free for about 6 weeks until last Thursday I took it and within 20 minutes had heart palpitations, followed by difficulty breathing then a very warm rash on my body (elbows, wrists, ears, kneecaps, collarbone). The rash was not hives, nor was it itchy, just a flat red rash that was very warm to the touch. The rash lasted 15-30 minutes then subsided. I was convinced it couldn't have been the vitamins because I had been taking them for a while. Until today when I took my vitamins again and had the same symptoms only this time it included anaphylaxis. I'm unsure whether this product has some sort of threshold problem which causes excess of a certain vitamin in the body or if it's a true allergic reaction to an ingredient in this product. Whatever the case may be, I found many other reviews that describe almost the exact type of reaction I had and I really feel that the company should do some further investigation into this issue. This product is being marketed for pregnant women and it's safety should be verified.",Severe allergic reaction,Allergic

"There are a lot of adaptogens on the market with positive effects similar to ashwagandha but without some of the side effects. For example, rhodiola can combat stress and anxiety and improve mood. When it comes to ashwagandha, the skin itchiness is real. After several days of taking the NOW Ashwagandha supplement, the itching became intolerable.<br /><br />Unfortunately the itchiness is worst at night. My last dose was Sunday night and I wasn't able to sleep most of that night. It took multiple doses of benadryl and melatonin, and hours of nearly involuntary scratching before I was able to get some sleep in stretches of 10-15 minutes in between tortuous bouts of painful itching.<br /><br />I'm now writing this Monday night and the itchiness has returned, as painful and debilitating as it was yesterday. Another restless night. Apparently it takes more than 24 hours for ashwaghanda--or it's residual effects--to leave your system.<br /><br />If you're still considering rolling the dice to receive some of the benefits ashwagandha can provide, please see your doctor first or consider trying a different supplement. Also try a quick keyword search for the word ""itch"" in the reviews for this product. You'll hear similar horror stories. You've been warned.  :)","Before you buy, read this!",Allergic

"As usual, the general quality of presentation was high, as you'd expect with Now Foods. The bottle was properly sealed, and the capsules were clean and dry. I know that sounds a little odd to say, but I've seen foreign particles or moisture in bottles of supplements before, so it's not to be taken for granted.<br /><br />As for the L-Tyrosine itself, I can only assume that it's high quality because so many other people seem to have benefited from it. The reason I'm giving this a 3-star is because, while Now Foods is generally quite good, the L-Tyrosine itself shouldn't be assumed to be an energy or mood panacea. I asked my doctor about it because I do struggle from fatigue and difficulty focusing that doesn't improve even with plenty of sleep every night, and she told me that it could possibly help and that, based on my medical history (always check with your doctor), there'd be no harm in my trying it.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the L-Tyrosine had the effect of making me feel anxious and even more tired. The effect was strong enough that I wasn't sure if I was going to have a panic attack or fall asleep. Pity. It seems to have helped so many people, and I was excited about how it might have helped me. Still, for those whom it may be an appropriate supplement, I do recommend this product.

These diapers are awful. I have used them for one day and have cleaned up more messes than what it is worth. Also because of the poor quality I am using even more than I have been. The last one there was more poop on me and the floor than in the actual diaper. I will not be buying this again.  And likely won't even use anymore that I bought. They are not like name brand. The elastic around the legs is none existent and they nothing... Literally nothing in.  My baby is not even moving yet so I can't imagine it would get better as she gets older.

"3 of us in our family have been using this product for 5 months. They taste great and they really work. My daughter's hair (which grows INSANELY slow) is the longest I've seen it in her almost 12 years of life. My fiance's hair was thinning and receding....not only has his hair thickened up on his head, but his beard is fuller than ever. My hair has also grown at a faster pace and my nails are stronger than ever.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I have been dealing with incessant itching all over my body and a red, bumpy, itchy rash on my scalp since last fall. I scheduled an appointment with the allergist a couple weeks ago to get a full allergy test panel ran. Incidentally, at the same time we ran out of these gummies. Suddenly within a few days, the rash disappeared and the itching subsided. I've since started taking a different biotin supplement (swallowable but actually a higher dose)...no itching or rash.<br /><br />I'm still waiting on the allergy results so I'm not certain what I'm allergic to. But something in these gummies triggered allergies in me nonetheless.","Works, but beware of allergies",Allergic

"This doesn't have a terrible flavor to it.  It tastes like chocolate with artificial sugar mixed with a tiny bit of dirt, so it has a bit of an aftertaste, but honestly, it tastes better than I anticipated.  It blends HORRIBLY in water, even in a blender.  I first tried it in my shaker bottle and it just got chunky and stayed at the bottle in the shaker ball, then I tried it in my Vitamix with just water and again it got chunky and stuck to the sides of the glass. When I mixed it with ice and water and some fruit it did a little better, but it still wasn't a smooth blend.

"I bought this product to help me fall asleep. It DID do that.  However, within two days of starting it, I woke up with excruciating back pain in my mid back. It hurt to breathe. I am not a person who suffers from back pain or problems and wondered what in the world I had done to hurt myself. Each night I would take the melatonin gummies and each morning I would wake with back pain. Two days after the back pain began I sneezed and my nose began bleeding. It bled so much my hands were full of blood by the time I realized what was happening and ran to the bathroom. My nose continued to bleed for almost 10 minutes. I also dont suffer from nosebleeds or have a clotting problem.<br /><br />After almost six days of agony in my back and a bloody nose, I thought back on what was different and realized the ONLY thing different was I had been taking those melatonin gummies. However, I couldnt believe a harmless sleep aid could do this to me. To test my theory I didnt take the gummies one night. The next morning I awoke with zero back pain. I felt great. That night I took the gummies again and the next morning I woke with excruciating back pain. (See the pattern here!) Again, I also experienced a traumatic nosebleed.  Neither of these things are listed in potential side effects.  However, the 1% contraindications do list pain and nosebleeds.  I guess I'm in the 1%, but I bet I'm not the only one. If you began experiencing back pain after taking these, stop like I did and see if your pain goes away.  While these may be helpful for bringing on sleep, the debilitating back pain is not worth it.  I hope this helps someone.",Back Pain and Nosebleeds,Allergic

"The reason i tried this product is i found a buy 2 get 1 free at a local shop. In other words 60 servings for about $80. I was laughing hysterically at the other reviews concerning bowel movements. I can definitely see how that will happen for some. It gives me gas pretty quickly but not the actual explosion like some others experienced. Ive taken it 5 or 6 times now. I take 1 full scoop in 12 oz. cold water. Lemon ice tastes good. The only other pwo ive used is c4 original (original recipe). I wish i could have endless supply of that stuff. You can tell they really dialed the new stuff back, because the same size bottle now has only 20 servings compared to 60 before. The scooper is a lot bigger now. Compared to original c4 with creatine and nitric oxide boost (yassss) this stuff just feels like you took a few shots of esspresso. Its all cafiene. That being said it gives me pretty good energy throughout my workout which goes 45-60 minutes. I only lift, no cardio, moderate to heavy weight. I think this is a good to average product but i will probably not buy again unless it goes on sale. The cost per serving is getting out if hand in this industry. $1.00 seems more than fair for any pwo. Combined with all the other crap we buy to stay “healthy”.

"I've been buying the 660g container size of this product from my local organic foods store for approximately 3 months now. At that store, the best price I've been able to get is $25.99 per container, and that was on sale.

Then I mix this with a spoon until i can't seem to get it to blend any further. I then sit down and consume the drink.

"My son has moderate eczema so I am wary of any products that contain a lot of allergens so I was super excited about these diapers. As far as the hypoallergenic aspect goes.. we have had no issues which makes these diapers a huge plus. They are really affordable compared to any other hypoallergenic diapers so I was hoping so desperately that these would be good, however after trying two boxes I have decided these just aren’t the best for us.<br /><br />Pros:<br />All white print<br />Good for slimmer babies (may need to size up from name brand sizing if you have a super chunky babe)<br />Hypoallergenic<br />Affordable<br /><br />Cons:<br />They shed, both the outside and the inside.

The smell of the cream wasn’t bad and it was very thick which was good for my dry skin but outside of that it wasn’t worth the money.<br /><br />To be quite honest I had doubts in believing a cream could do what the reviews had noted but either I was hormonal when I ordered it or my desire to conceive had me foolishly believing anything.  I could see a cream helping heal skin abrasions or muscle soreness but to believe this could help improve mood or boost conception is about as far reaching a claim as saying using a mouthwash for 30 days will make you win the lottery.

I'm going to use this all up but return to Optimum Nutrition.","Edible and high protein, but way too sweet for me",Bad Taste/Flavor
"Very poor product and of all the protein powders we have purchased from ""X Brand"" it is by far the worst. Almost no chocolate flavor and leaves an irritating residue that is hard to rinse out of our mouths. As the title says we would return if they took food products back. Very disappointing .",Would send back if I Could,Allergic

"Really bummed the “softgels” are discontinued. This new version with the v-caps are huge! I was hoping maybe they would still be smaller than the normal v-caps but NOPE. As someone who has a hard time with pills,  would way rather take 3 of the old softgels then 2 of these giant monsters. The supplement themselves are amazing and a staple for us on any boat vacation/cruise, they definitely work (even if you’re not super sensitive with seasickness, they just make you feel better). We used to take 2-3 of the softgels in the AM / 2-3 in the PM and you’re golden. Start taking 2 days before trip and keep taking for 1 day after (made the mistake once of not taking it the day after we got off the boat and had the sways real bad).",BRING BACK THE SOFTGELS!!,Quality/Contaminated

"I have been using this product for almost 2 years. It gives me enough protein and calories to burn. However, for the past 12 months, I have changed flavors a few times due to lack of flavor. What I meant is every time I ordered any flavors, it just tastes plain. I recently exchanged another chocolate flavor, it still tastes plain, not chocolate. No matter how many times I exchange it, 1 out of 6 times, I get the flavor that actually tastes as it says.",lack of flavor,Allergic

"First off, I applaud ""X Brand"" Elements for their transparency and commitment to product quality and purity.  It is unheard of in the supplement market.<br /><br />So why the one star?<br /><br />I unfortunately seem to be allergic to these, as I break out into a rash about 20 minutes after taking them (with or without an empty stomach).  I'm not allergic to any foods or drugs that I know of and I have taken lots of different brands of multi-vitamins in the past, so I have to conclude that there is something specific in this formulation that is causing my rash.<br /><br />Its really unfortunate that this is happening as I otherwise was very happy with the product.","Applaud the transparency, sad about the rash",Allergic

"I had these delivered before and the shipping box came with padding so all ok. This time however, no padding in the shipping box and when I opened the vitamin box the bottle was shattered; the top and bottom were in pieces - shards of glass, and the body of the bottle itself was in pieces held together by the label.  The vitamins have fine shards of glass all over them. There does not seem to be an option to inform ""X Brand"" they messed up and to send another bottle...only option for me is to return the shattered glass and pills via UPS...which is a waste of my time and resources. The nearest ""X Brand"" drop off location is in another city, though there is a Whole Foods 2 blocks away.  ""X Brand"" - please take note. I will send the pills back via UPS. I will pass on sending all the shattered glass.","Product great but packaging from ""X Brand"" inadequate - bottle shattered",Packaging
"Do not buy from these distributors! I thought I would order most pills for least price despite warnings I read in reviews. I was stunned when I took off the seal under the lid at the very strong smell of ammonia... or bleach! scent! I quickly requested refund and will send those back with hopes that someone will investigate WHAT is being sent out in these bottles!

"These gummies aren't bad. They really helped me get through a few weeks in my pregnancy where I was gagging on everything, especially my giant usual pre-natal vitamins.

"It's in the upper half of brands that shake well without a blender. It has a very clean flavor; They've managed to eliminate a lot of offensive protein chemical tastes, and we're left with a smooth clean mild milky chocolate. emphasis on mild.
