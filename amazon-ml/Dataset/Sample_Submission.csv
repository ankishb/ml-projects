"I recently gave up my daily 6 cups of coffee, I know, sad day. I love coffee, and I drink my coffee black so I can really enjoy the taste of each bean, strength, and roast. I got this coffee knowing up front that I wouldn't be satisfied without the caffeine component, so I won't let that influence my review. With that being said, I am a little disappointed with the overall flavor of this coffee. Being a Colombian Arabica blend, you expect there to be a little bitterness to it, but in my opinion it was a little over the top. I found myself having to put less grinds and more water to get it to the taste that I could appreciate. Perhaps I just like my coffee strong. If you are a cream or sugar mixer, I don't think this will be much of an issue for you. But for the avid dark coffee drinker, this one may not be for you... after all, it is unleaded!",Flavor was dissapointing,Bitter
"Meh. I've adored Peruvian coffee for 20 years. I'm hunting for a supplier during the Peruvian off-season (why is this varietal only available to buy for two months a year?!). I purchased this and another brand. Both are a big &#34;meh&#34;. Boring. Smooth, but almost flavorless. A &#34;meh&#34; at best, disappointing purchase at worst. I'll keep hunting for another brand, or wait another couple months for season to return.",Smooth but majorly bland. Won't repurchase.,
