"""X Brand"" has failed to deliver what they offer on this page twice, with me ordering a 3-pack and delivering only one. No thank you, not worth the money for just one when competitors can offer way cheaper for just one. I thought I was getting a 3-pack not a 1-pack when I order a 3-pack. It makes sense to me numerically to give a customer a 3-pack of an item when you order a 3-pack not a 1-pack. I understand mistakes could happen, however, I asked for a replacement item due to ""Missing Parts or Broken Parts"" and explained in my comments there that I had ordered a 3-pack not a 1-pack. Then they shipped out to me another 1-pack of this item. The title does not reflect the 3-pack nature of the 3-pack choice. Therefore, the warehouse folk do not know that it is a 3-pack. Let this be a warning to the folks who expect three items but only receive one, to have to ask ""X Brand"" to try and correct it.<br /><br />I have never experienced this with ""X Brand"" before and I hope an employee can see this so they correct the mistake the page reflects so no other customer has to deal with the hassle. It is unfortunate that suggestions cannot be made for titles of items so it can reflect what is actually purchased. The 2-pack says it's a 2-pack in the title, why can't the 3-pack have the same?

"As a vegetarian (not vegan)who recently started a boot camp workout routine, I’ve been looking for extra ways to supplement my protein. I’d previously been using Isopure Zero Carb, but the whey was starting to irritate my stomach. I found Garden Of Life Raw Protein at my local Lucky’s Market and decided to give it a try since I love chai flavor. A quick peak at the ""X Brand"" rating showed 4 stars, and they had individual serving packets that would let me try without committing to the tub, so I figured why not. Once I got home, I started reading the recent reviews and was a bit less confident. Tried it anyway. While the flavor isn’t bad, the texture is so difficult to stomach. Like... it’s really bad. Have to choke it down bad. It mixes okay (no heavy chunks of powder or anything), but is so grainy it’s like drinking wet sand. You’d think it was a lesson learned, but I decided to give the chocolate flavor a shot. This time I blended it with ice because certainly THAT would hide the texture. Nope. Same gritty texture, just colder. Wish I’d gotten to try this before the reformulation so I could see what the old reviews were raving about.

"As of this review this bottle of adult vitamins cost $22.39.  It's for a four month supply and only one pill per day is the dosage given, though the amount of a lot of the vitamins is only 1/2 the RDA.  If two were taken then the full amount plus some extra would be taken.  They're basically o.k. except for the vitamin D2 content instead D3.  Vitamin manufacturers often use D2 instead because it's cheaper to produce thus saving them money, but it's not really much good.  D2 mostly goes right through the digestive tract and into the toilet so very little get absorbed and it does practically nothing for bone health.  D3 on the other hand, costs a little more to manufacture, but is by far a superior form of vitamin D.  Most of it gets absorbed and combined with a good K2 does a good job at maintaining good bone health.  I would be sure to take a good D3 supplement if taking these vitamins.<br /><br />The iron content might be too high for post menopausal women and I don't really know if men should be taking more iron or not.  But, it's a good amount for women who are menstruating.  18 mg is the RDA and one of these pills gives 9 mg but that's not too bad.

"As someone with very very pale skin that burns easily, I always wear a facial cream with SPF. I have been fooled by the product labels on multiple items though - I don't want just a sunscreen, I want a moisturizer that contains sunscreen. Big difference! I was a little worried by the labeling on this item as well - is it a moisturizer or a sunscreen? Well, this definitely falls in the sunscreen category. It has that sunscreen smell and consistency, and absorbs like sunscreen - so you're left with a shiny face if wearing it alone. I've found products like this are good to use over other moisturizers that don't contain any SPF - for example, my favorite winter face cream is Laneige Water Bank Moisture Cream, which does not have SPF.","Sunscreen, not a moisturizer",Ingredients

I was a little worried by the labeling on this item as well - is it a moisturizer or a sunscreen? Well, this definitely falls in the sunscreen category. It has that sunscreen smell and consistency, and absorbs like sunscreen - so you're left with a shiny face if wearing it alone. I've found products like this are good to use over other moisturizers that don't contain any SPF - for example, my favorite winter face cream is Laneige Water Bank Moisture Cream, which does not have SPF.","Sunscreen, not a moisturizer",Texture

"For some reason I feel bad giving these only 3 stars... I really wanted to like them.<br /><br />I was on the search for an affordable diaper I can use for my 3 month old during the day to possibly save money so I don’t use the Pampers Swaddlers constantly. I’ve tried a lot (Up&Up, Luvs, Huggies, cloud island, etc) and most of them end up give my little guy a diaper rash or don’t absorb the liquid breastfed poop well enough and leak everywhere. These mamabear diapers are just the same. I didn’t feel like they absorbed the pee and poop as well as Pampers or even Huggies. It definitely didn’t wick away poop moisture from his butt and it often leaked through the leg holes and up the back because of that. And it gave my little guy a diaper rash unfortunately. And I don’t like the design of the front part of the diaper- it’s hard to explain but it’s not contoured to his hips with flaps on the front that would wrap around his waist, there’s just a lot of diaper material that seems to have to be shoved between his legs which seems uncomfortable to me.<br />Couldn’t even keep using these because of the leakage and rash problem, had to return. For a similar price I prefer Huggies or Costco brand diapers.",Not for me,Quality/Contaminated
Formulation is certainly interesting with this skin care supplement product (daily dose = 2x pills) as the primary active ingredient is something called 'Lutemax 2020 (derived from Marigolds) and Vitamin A Retinyl Palmitate. Pills are very easy to swallow as they are small (pinto bean sized) and smoothly coated. Leaves behind no unpleasant odors or after taste and does not produce adverse reactions in myself at least. Only problem is just over a month cycle its quite difficult to discern if this produced any noticeable positive effects.,Interesting formulation but hard to gauge efficacy,Too_big_to_swallow

I started taking it again and the first day that I started taking it again, the nasty headache returned.  It's like all the nerve endings inside my head shoots pain.

"Garden of Life products are an absolute favorite of mine.

I believe they are not strong enough even if you take 2-3 a day. I wasn't doing as well as I did on 15 mg of k2 mk4.

I can tell that works because my teeth are a lot cleaner/smother with no calcium build-up. I didn't get this with the mk7. We all metabolize supplements different.

"I bought these Nature's Bounty Ginkgo Biloba 120mg, 100 Capsules, about 6 weeks ago, and shortly after using for a few days, began to experience indigestion on pretty much a daily basis.  Tried keeping track of what i was eating, thinking maybe food related, but didn't seem to be.  So stopped taking the capsules, and after a couple of days, no more indigestion.  Started taking them again, just to see what would happen, and back to the same problem.  Called the company, and asked if indigestion was a side effect of the supplement and the rep, and then his supervisor, said they didn't know.  I asked if they kept any records of customers reporting this side effect, and was told they are not required to keep records, because this is not a prescription medication.  So, unable to get any information whatsoever about the product, but got sick taking it, and wasted money  buying it.  Guess i should know better.  They did not offer to reimburse for the capsules....apparently this is not their policy.

"I felt the moral obligation to write this review to let unsuspecting buyers know that while ALA is certainly healthy, you need a much higher amount than you'll get from this product if you're looking for a vegan alternative to fish oil, unless you're taking about 15 capsules per day. The NIH says the conversion rate for ALA to EPA and DHA is between 5% and 10%: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9637947. Usually, 500mg of EPA and DHA is the recommended minimum, so a 5% conversion from ALA would mean you need to consume 10 grams of ALA for a proper conversion to replace fish oil.<br /><br />Personally I would recommend just buying ground flaxseed and adding that to your food. You'd save money over buying this supplement. And for the linoleic acid and oleic acid content of this supplement, these are just common polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat. You would get a higher dose from eating a single peanut.",Very insignificant amount of ALA,Ingredients

"I had been taking the Kirkland general daily multivitamins (not women specific) and was curious to compare these. To be fair the Kirkland ones aren't vegan, but they are also much cheaper, so that's a bit of a wash. These are about 35% bigger than the Kirkland vitamins -- quite large, though I didn't have any difficulty swallowing them. They also definitely have a smell, though it's not terrible. The label was oddly hard to read ((maybe mine just had a funky printing job), but the bottle was easy to<br />open and close. The thing that was weird to me and dropped this to three stars is the very low level of calcium in the vitamins. They only offer 3% of the daily calcium allocation, while standard vitamins are usually 20 to 35%, and women's specific vitamins are usually a bit higher even than that. I don't drink nearly enough milk and have some history of osteoporosis in the family, so calcium is one of the most important supplements I watch for in a daily multivitamins. So that's a deal killer for me -- you could always take an additional supplement, but why bother when almost all other vitamin brands have plenty of cacium? All told, these are fine multivitamins for other nutrients, and bonus points for being vegan, but if you're needing calcium as part of your supplement like I am then you might want to consider another brand.",Oddly Low Calcium,Texture

The shake is otherwise really good. I like the way it blends, and I am able to get the stated 18 servings per container without issue. It keeps me feeling full all morning just like the Essentials shake did. I just preferred the taste of the Essentials because it’s not quite as sweet.

I had taken the Nature Made Prenatal throughout 2 pregnancies and never had any issues. I found these postnatal and decided to give them a try while nursing my 2nd child.

"I have a couple different brands of BCAAs that I really like, but I hadn't tried the optimum version. On the whole I am a big fan of optimum products, I think they easily make the best Whey Protein and Micellular Creatine, but this product is just garbage.<br /><br />The flavor is pretty bad, but beyond that it is barely noticable (yes, I am mixing in the correct amount of water). So the flavor is super suttle, but also sub-par, so the overall flavor comes out like old nasty water. Beyond this, I have never felt an immediate effect from BCAAs before. Usually they are something that I drink mid workout or during fasted cardio to stay anabolic and see better results overtime. This BCAA formula, however, hits me in a way that I can immediately notice. I get jittery almost like I am drinking a preworkout. Ultimately not a good feeling. I have even had immediate changes in my vision, which is something I have not ever experienced from any supplement.<br /><br />Overall I would recommend that Optimum change this formula and I would recommend that you avoid purchasing. BPI Best BCAA and Ghost Lifestyle BCAA are easily the best alternatives currently on the market and I would strongly recommend either of those competitors over this product.<br /><br />Will not order again, but I do still love Optimum as a brand for their superior Whey Protein and Creatine products.

"I have a hard time falling asleep some nights.  Mostly it's because I have a lot on my mind and I can't shut it off until I'm so dead tired I finally fall asleep after nearly 2 hours of just lying there.  Luckily this is not the norm, but can happen about once or twice a week, especially after a stressful day at work.  I've been using Diphenhydramine for my sleep aid and it works very well.  It can usually send me to sleep about 30 minutes after taking it, and I wake up rested and ready to go.<br />I thought I would give a natural sleep aid a shot, because I would rather use a natural sleep aid than a chemical one.  I've tried using this melatonin product 3 different times under the same circumstances that I would have used Diphenhydramine, but this did not send me to sleep like Diphenhydramine does.  Sure I eventually fall asleep, but after over an hour and that's not what I'm looking for.  For all I know that was just normal fatigue causing me to sleep.

I love using grape seed oil and I love this brand. However this arrived broken and made a huge mess. The oil was packed in a brown box with no bubble wrap or anything to prevent it from banging around. Then a white bubble envelope around the box but it didn’t prevent the cap from splitting off during shipping. Shipped by FedEx so no surprise it arrived broken.  I did notify the seller so hopefully they will package the oil with some paper or bubble wrap inside the box for future orders. Luckily the safety seal is still in place or else the whole bottle wouldn’t spilled out. I couldn’t figure out how the product came out with the seal still on but then I squeezed the bottle and saw that the oil seeped around the seal. I’ll post a video,Arrived broken and made a mess,Texture

"I purchased another variety of vitamin (Undeniable Beauty, with C, E, Biotin and Keratin) and LOVED them and had great results. Before I even opened the bottle of these I could smell a very strong smell of vitamins. Which is totally different than the experience I had with their other product. It was worse than the smell from the tablets I usually taste. I almost didn't eat one but I took a chance and regretted from the moment I put it in my mouth. The gummy tasted like pure vitamins, and not in a good way. I'd much rather take my regular multi-vitamin. I tasted vitamins in my mouth and burped it up for hours. I tried to give them to my mom and she couldn't take it either. I don't know how the two products from the same company can vary so much. The other product had ZERO vitamin taste, I left that other product I mentioned a 5-star review. I had to throw the bottle away because I couldn't take the smell, never had an experience like that with vitamins, where you could smell them with the jar closed. Maybe I got a bad jar?

Just tried it again a third time after finding it on the back of my shelf...still a no-go lol.<br /><br />I'm surprised bc there's so many positive reviews about it having no aftertaste. My only thought is that I am a ""supertaster""...so perhaps I'm just more sensitive to the 11% cane alcohol it's dissolved in?  It's sweet...so there's that!<br /><br />I'm just sad bc I wasted money... But c'est la vie. It would've been a superb deal if I liked it. :)",Very disappointed,Bad_Taste/Flavor

"I've been using Cetaphil, per my dermatologist's instructions, since I was a pimply teenager.  I am now 43, and still use this every night to clean my face. I like that it is a gentle product that isn't irritating to my sensitive, acne prone, and now ageing skin.  Critical to me are the fact that the cleanser is affordable, non-comedogenic, and fragrance free<br /><br />When I saw that ""X Brand""'s brand Solimo, created a similar gentle skin cleanser.  Considering that Solimo sells its cleanser for $2.00 less than Cetaphil, I thought it was worth a try to determine whether it was worth a permanent switch.<br /><br />The consistency of the cleanser is very similar to Cetaphil; it is a viscous, opaque soap that pumps easily from the bottle.  It is a gentle cleanser, therefore, it can be used with water or without.  When traveling without access to hot water, I notice that just rubbing on my face and wiping off with a washcloth works just fine.  With access to normal amenities, I always wash off the cleanser with warm water and towel dry.<br /><br />This cleanser can also be used with or without water.  I noticed a difference however, in that wen I applied th ecleanser to my face, I detected a slight stinging - nothing that would really be noticeable, but noticeable tome because I have never gotten that sensation with Cetaphil.  The cleanser also dried my face out a tiny bit more than Cetaphil.  Again, a very small difference, but something I didn't really enjoy.<br /><br />I would definitely use this in a pinch if I was out of my regular cleanser, but I won't be switching products permanently anytime soon.",Kind of Sort of Comparable to Cetaphil,Allergic

It doesn't show on your skin except for a shininess when it's first applied.<br /><br />A couple of days after I got this product, a spider or one of his buggy kin thoughtfully bit me so I could test this.  It may work differently for you, but for me and my spider (or whatever) bite, it didn't seem to do much.  It's worth a try to see if it works better for you because if it does, you can certainly save money, but I'm going to stick to Sarna.",Sarna Works Much Better For Me,Not_Effective

"It’s a challenge to find whey free and soy free protein supplements, but Garden of Life definitely helps with that challenge.

"My review is more regarding creatine in general rather the optimum brand- which makes great suppliments.<br /><br />I bought this about a month after starting rogaine so my hair was already thinning. My hair quickly started rapidly thinning...I know this by frequently cleaning hair clogging my shower drain, which had never happened before. I read rogaine causes hair shedding in the beginning and I assumed it was from that. After like 4 months of still rapidly loosing hair I made an appt with a hair loss specialist. From her, I realized creatine might had been the cause so I stopped using it. My hair loss rapidly slowed and I’m not cleaning the drain anymore. Apparently all the hair you lose due to creatine will grow back once you stop, so fingers crossed that’s my case.  Since for me hair is more important than muscles, I won’t be using creatine ever again. I’m aware other people might not feel the same or won’t have the same side effect as me. I just wanted anyone to know that if you do take it, be aware you could lose hair and monitor that","Beware, can majorly accelerate hair loss. Monitor use if concerned",Allergic

"So I dont know about buying this online. Ive been taking this product for about 2 years now and i love it, but in the past I bought it at CVS. When I saw this sale I was extremely excited for the price value because youre basically getting buy one get one free..<br />That should have been my first warning. The taste was off but I thought nothing of it because the taste was a little harsh to begin with. Then I started getting a head rash. I thought it was from other products so i changed everything back to what i knew wouldnt cause it and for MONTHS I still had it. I had gotten another shipment of these from ""X Brand"" because I never in the past had that happen from these pills and i didnt think it was from them at the time, but I still had a rash and had no idea where it was coming from. I finally decided to stop taking this to see what would happen since it was the only supplement I was taking. And what do you know? A week after i stopped taking the pills my rash was gone. Completely. I dont know if someone switched these pills or if they are sold so cheaply because they are actually expired, all i know is that when i bought then in store the previous two years this never happened. So that sucked and now I have two bottles I have to throw away.",Gave me a head rash. For months.,Allergic

"So I've been using these diapers for about a month now. They are super cute and not a whole lot different from Huggies. I should start out saying I'm using these with my 4th child.

I did try Pampers (to me it didn't hide the urine smell) and I tried Luvs (who apparently changed their diaper design. They were noisy and smaller than they use to be).

"So I’m very health-conscious and try to take care of myself as best as I can. It’s important that I do so after years of abuse that I put my poor body through in the form of a life-threatening eating disorder. I crawled back from death more than a few times and now I’m finally in lasting recovery (knock on wood). I make sure I eat enough, exercise for health, and take a quality multivitamin (or right now, since I’m pregnant, prenatals). Sometimes I add additional single vitamins on their own to boost what’s in the multi. (More doesn’t always mean better when it comes to vitamins, though, so do your research and/or check with your healthcare professional. And remember - a healthy diet is the foundation of good health! 😉)<br /><br />I am usually not a fan of gummy vitamins because they contain mostly sugar and the percentage of the vitamins are way too low. I call them “glorified candy,” lol. Any gummy vitamin/supplement required you to down numerous gummies to equal the same amount in one capsule or tablet form. I decided to try these anyway because I figured since the percentage of vitamins aren’t too high, I could incorporate these into my pregnancy diet as an occasional treat and not overdo anything. I also liked that contain keratin.<br /><br />My bag of OLLY Undeniable Beauty Gummy arrived very fresh and soft and I really enjoy the refreshing grapefruit flavor. I do feel like I’m treating myself to some candy when I eat these - and since candy is just empty calories, it’s not something I indulge in too often. But everything in moderation, right? 😉<br /><br />I think these (and gummy vitamins/supplements in general) are best suited for people who just cannot swallow pills/capsules or for people who never take any vitamins and feel that taking a couple of these a day will be better than taking nothing. Like I stated a couple of times already, I don’t think the percentage of the necessary vitamins/supplement (in this case vitamin c, biotin, as well as keratin) are high enough to really do much on their own. At 2 gummies per serving and the bag being only a 30 day supply, it just isn’t a very cost-effective choice.<br /><br />I’m actually going to save the rest of these for after I give birth in September. In the postpartum period after I had my son 3.5 years ago, my hair fell out like you would not believe. It was completely distressing after having a thick, luxurious mane for the 9.5 months prior to his birth and I was so surprised I didn’t go bald. Lol and 😡. (It really is amazing how much hair is on the human head. Or maybe my hair loss looked even worse since my hair is long. In any case, losing all that hair is NOT something I want to experience ever again. Shudder. 😖)<br /><br />I will continue taking my prenatals and add these OLLY Undeniable Gummy vitamins after Baby Girl arrives. I will make sure to update and let you know how things go. Fingers crossed! 🤞",Yummy gummy vitamin+keratin. A spendy treat that has more merit than plain gummy candies.,Color_and_texture

I'm on my 3rd month of it and still not getting my period, after the one initial time, I'm pretty sure it was a fluke not related to the pills. Meaning the pills did not start my period.

"So, I took these for a week and couldn't tell they helped anything digestively speaking.  So I took a bunch to see if they did anything at all or were basically placebos.

This cool mist scent body wash had potential and I had high hopes.  Isn't often I am really disappointed in a body wash.  When I opened the bottle the scent was refreshing and natural.

"This is a fairly expensive multivitamin at over twice the cost per daily dose of standard daily multivitamins. Much of this likely revolves around the actual content, which is significantly more than a standard multivitamin provides. A standard multivitamin generally has 100% of the recommended daily dose for each ingredient. In this case, however, we see about 20 times that for thiamin and riboflavin (B1 and B2), 15x that for B6, 10x that for B7 (biotin) and B12, and so forth. Essentially, you are getting a high dose of the B vitamins, but there's also twice the usual amount of copper, 5x the usual dose of pantothenic acid and well over 100% for Vitamins A and C.<br /><br />More of something good is not necessarily a good thing. There are potential side effects for taking more than the recommended quantity of several of the B vitamins. And those with certain medical disorders would want to be careful about several of the other components here. Bottom line: talk with your doctor before taking this particular multivitamin formulation, and if you're simply looking for a high quality multivitamin rather than wanting to experiment with high doses of any of these components, look elsewhere. In the meantime, if you do decide to take these, one pill rather than the product-recommended two a day would likely be the right place to start.<br /><br />Note that the content and nutritional information on the product label is underneath the main product label, which can be easily peeled back to reveal the information so that it's there on your shelf and won't be confused with other products.",High dose B vitamins and greater than typical overall dosages compared to standard multivitamin.,Quality/Contaminated

After that initial brief taste, all you will taste is salt.  You cannot even get the peach flavor again after that very first taste.  Looking at the label, it is sincerely full of salt.  I couldn't even take another drink of this stuff.  Even now I cringe and gag a little at the memory of the taste.",Salt Shakes,Bad_Taste/Flavor

"This was my go-to product for drinkable potassium at 400mg per serving. I used it every day for years, for heartbeat stabilization and energy. Now, it's useless, and does the opposite of replenishing potassium. It makes a sodium imbalance worse, because there is double the sodium than potassium, and not enough potassium to bother. It's amounts larger than 1-200mg that need to be in water. For only 100mg, I can take a capsule. I cannot believe they ruined such a good product.

I have no idea if those ingredients will give me diarrhea or should I return this.<br /><br />UPdate: I gave a try for 2 days, as it seems this item is highly rated. BAD! I had major cramps , bloating and diarrhea that I almost didn't make it the bathroom without an accident!<br />One thing I gotta tell is the taste is too sweet, not a good sugar sweet but artifically sweet, its horrible. U gotta dillute it with a lot more water in order to make it feasible, but taste doesn't even matter if u got the squirts!<br /><br />However, The kind kings of ""X Brand"" is issuing me a refund and I don't have to return the item! The last place I tried to get a refund , they did not pay shipping and that was 28.00! I had paid almost as much as I paid for the powder! (32.99  total)  So I really have to give my hats off to ""X Brand"", they get 5 stars. The review star is for the protein powder, not the store!",Wth why the ingredients switch?

"Yes. It tastes like cough syrup.  It was not tasty even if you put it in the water. This makes me not want to try the other flavora, but I heard the English toffee is good.
