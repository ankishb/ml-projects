felt the moral obligation write this review let unsuspecting buyers know that while ala certainly healthy you need much higher amount than you will get from this product you are looking for vegan alternative fish oil unless you are taking about capsules per day the nih says the conversion rate for ala epa and dha between and https ncbi nlm nih gov pubmed usually epa and dha the recommended minimum conversion from ala would mean you need consume grams ala for proper conversion replace fish oil personally would recommend just buying ground flaxseed and adding that your food you would save money over buying this supplement and for the linoleic acid and oleic acid content this supplement these are just common polyunsaturated fat and monounsaturated fat you would get higher dose from eating single peanut,Very insignificant amount of ALA,Ingredients

this fairly expensive multivitamin over twice the cost per daily dose standard daily multivitamins much this likely revolves around the actual content which significantly more than standard multivitamin provides standard multivitamin generally has the recommended daily dose for each ingredient this case however see about times that for thiamin and riboflavin and that for that for biotin and and forth essentially you are getting high dose the vitamins but there also twice the usual amount copper the usual dose pantothenic acid and well over for vitamins and more something good not necessarily good thing there are potential side effects for taking more than the recommended quantity several the vitamins and those with certain medical disorders would want careful about several the other components here bottom line talk with your doctor before taking this particular multivitamin formulation and you are simply looking for high quality multivitamin rather than wanting experiment with high doses any these components look elsewhere the meantime you decide take these one pill rather than the product recommended two day would likely the right place start note that the content and nutritional information the product label underneath the main product label which can easily peeled back reveal the information that there your shelf and will not confused with other products,High dose B vitamins and greater than typical overall dosages compared to standard multivitamin.,Ingredients

had been taking the kirkland general daily multivitamins not women specific and was curious compare these fair the kirkland ones are not vegan but they are also much cheaper that bit wash these are about bigger than the kirkland vitamins quite large though did not have any difficulty swallowing them they also definitely have smell though not terrible the label was oddly hard read maybe mine just had funky printing job but the bottle was easy open and close the thing that was weird and dropped this three stars the very low level calcium the vitamins they only offer the daily calcium allocation while standard vitamins are usually and women specific vitamins are usually bit higher even than that not drink nearly enough milk and have some history osteoporosis the family calcium one the most important supplements watch for daily multivitamins that deal killer for you could always take additional supplement but why bother when almost all other vitamin brands have plenty cacium all told these are fine multivitamins for other nutrients and bonus points for being vegan but you are needing calcium part your supplement like then you might want consider another brand,Oddly Low Calcium,Ingredients
