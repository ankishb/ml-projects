# Recommendation engine(user-problem relation)
Problem Statement: Recommend next problem to solve for, based on user performance. 
My main concerns was to handle following question carefully:
1. What is the strongest and weakest area of user?
2. What is the level of problem?
3. What problem user have just solved?
4. If user gets stuck at current problem, what problem should help him(to gain confidence and to improve skill in that area)?
5. Exploration and explotation strategy in recommending problem.
6. and many more?
